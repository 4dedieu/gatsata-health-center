<u>At Gatsata Health Center</u>, we are committed to providing comprehensive healthcare services to our community. As part of our commitment to promoting health and well-being, we offer HIV counseling and testing (HCT) services.<br><br>

<u>What is HIV Counseling and Testing?</u>
<br><br>

HIV counseling and testing, often referred to as HCT, is a vital component of HIV prevention, treatment, and care. It involves providing individuals with information about HIV transmission, risk reduction strategies, and the importance of knowing one's HIV status. Counseling also addresses the emotional and psychological aspects of HIV testing, helping individuals cope with anxiety, fear, and stigma associated with HIV.<br><br>

<u>Our Approach</u>
<br><br>

At Gatsata Health Center, we recognize the importance of providing confidential and non-judgmental HIV counseling and testing services.

We adhere to strict confidentiality protocols to ensure privacy and respect for every individual's right to confidentiality.<br><br>

<u>Why Get Tested?</u>
<br><br>

Knowing your HIV status is the first step towards taking control of your health. Early detection of HIV allows for timely access to life-saving treatment and care. By getting tested, you not only protect your own health but also contribute to HIV prevention efforts in our community.
